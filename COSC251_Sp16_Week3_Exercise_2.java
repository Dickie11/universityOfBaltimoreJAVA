		 * Pick the right type of mortgage
		 * You will write a program to pick the right type of mortgage
		 * for a potential home buyer
		 * 
		 * The possible outcomes are 
		 *   -Fixed-rate 
		 *   -Adjustable rate 
		 *   -Interest-only 
		 *   -VA loan 
		 *   -FHA loan 
		 *   -Subprime 
		 *   -Jumbo
		 *   -Balloon
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Subprime is for people who have credit problems and don't qualify for other loans, they
		 * comes with overall higher rates
		 * 
		 * 
		 * The following are longer term mortgage (over 10 years):
		 * Fixed-rate,  VA loan, FHA loan
		 *
		 * 
		 * 
		 * The following are short term
		 * Adjustable rate, Interest-only, and Balloon
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Jumbo loans are required if the value of the mortgage is over $420,000
		 * no matter the duration of the loan
		 * 
		 * A fixed rate requires that the borrower has about 10% of the value of the house to put down.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * If the borrower is a vet, a VA loan is generally the best option
		 * 
		 * 
		 * If the borrower is a first time buyer, doesn't have a lot to put down, and the house is in
		 * good condition (meets FHA inspection), the FHA loan is best.
		 *  
		 * 
		 * Interest only loans can be good if the borrower expects to
		 * be earning considerable higher wages within the next 10 years
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Balloon loans have better terms for up to 10 years but 
		 * require that the loan is paid at the end of the term which
		 * makes the borrower either pay the balance, refinance, or sell
		 * 
		 *
		 *Adjustable rates change with the standard federal rate are generally preferred 
		 *if the current interest rate is elevated 
		 *making it likely to go down at some point.
